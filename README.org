* Convert a Things CSV Export to an Org TODO list
Might be a bit of a niche problem. But if, like me, you regularly swap between a Mac and Linux workstation and want a way to import your Things 3 todo list across to Emacs, this could help you out.
** Dependencies
Requires [[https://github.com/AlexanderWillner/things.sh][things.sh]]
** Usage
Run this with `go run main.go` after exporting you Things csv to ~/Todo

** TODO
- [ ] Add more fields to properties
- [ ] Check for things.sh at launch
- [ ] Allow users to specify path to their csv
- [ ] Fix due dates so they aren't in the 70's
  - This appears to be an issue with how "things.sh" exports the due dates
  - Doesn't impact any other dates (creation, modified, etc.)
- [ ] Pass arguments to add certain fields to Todos
- [ ] Group Todos by Projects or Areas
